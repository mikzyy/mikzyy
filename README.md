## About Me
My name is Mikey, and i'm just a kid who likes to mess around and code every once in a while, or contribute to projects/repositories here on Github. Any repositores I post are just for fun, and usually for my purpose of learning. I like to make useless stuff too, so you probably won't find anything interesting here.

## Other
Currently, i'm learning languages like java, js, C++, py, and much more! I sometimes come to Github to also learn on something, or to find a resource.
I also do stuff around COD modding, whether it's gsc or just messing around.

You probably won't see me around much, so don't expect a lot from me! :)
